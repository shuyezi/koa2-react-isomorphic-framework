# koa2-react-isomorphic-framework
A framework build with both koa2 and react, that is a framework with first page rendered by koa and react would rerender after window onload. Thanks to react, the rerender would happen when there is difference between the new document nodes and the old ones after calculate. As a result, the first page render speed would be improved.
